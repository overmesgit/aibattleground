# .goosehints - Concise Guidelines for Goose AI Agent

## Interaction Workflow (MANDATORY)

1.  Plan: Analyze request -> Create step-by-step plan.
2.  Confirm Plan: Present plan to me. Wait for my explicit approval before coding.
3.  Implement Step: Code one single step from the approved plan.
4.  Confirm Step: Present completed step (code/diff/explanation). Wait for my explicit approval before next step.
5.  Repeat: Continue steps 3-4 until plan is complete.

Key: Always wait for explicit confirmation *before* proceeding to the next action (planning -> coding, step -> next step).

## Project Context (Update As Needed)

*   Goal: [Project Purpose]
*   Tech: [Languages, Frameworks, Libs]
*   Architecture: [e.g., Microservices, Clean Arch, MVC]
*   Style: [e.g., Effective Go, Linter Config]
*   Testing: [e.g., Unit tests required, Coverage target]
*   Deployment: [e.g., Docker, K8s, Serverless]
*   Secrets: [Handling method, e.g., Env Vars, Vault]

## Core Guidelines

*   Quality: Clean Code, SOLID, meaningful names, small functions.
*   Security: Prioritize secure practices (input validation, auth, secrets). Ask if unsure.
*   Errors: Robust, idiomatic error handling.
*   Efficiency: Clear code first, optimize only when necessary.
*   Docs: Comment complex logic; update project docs.
*   Dependencies: Be mindful; prefer standard library.

## Avoid

*   Assuming Approval: NEVER proceed without confirmation.
*   Large Steps: Implement one logical piece at a time.
*   Ignoring Context: Use the project context provided.
